# JHU Deep Learning in Genomics Journal Club

Official page for the Johns Hopkins Deep Learning in Genomics Journal Club. We meet biweekly to review the latest literature on the use of Artificial Intelligence, especially modern Transformer-based Large Language Models, to solve questions in Genomics. We also discuss general topics around Deep Learning such as interpretability. 

This repository serves as a reference for the materials we discuss. Each meeting, one of our members selects a recent article to present and develops a slide deck to explain it to the group. In the presentation/ folder, we record all of these presentations in chronological order. Please review these slides for detailed explanations of their corresponding papers and to get a sense of what our group considers important literature in the field.

Our meetings are open to all! Please contact us at genomicdeeplearning@cs.jhu.edu to learn more or to get in touch.
